# StoneRoad
This mod slows down the progression to copper age, plus adds a few interesting new ways to perform routine tasks. It currently depends, implicitly, on the mod Ancient Tools, though really just that mod's adze.

Stone Road is sort of a stand-in until In Dappled Groves is fully released.

Roughly, here are the changes and the progression path to copper age:

* Wood is no longer chopped in the grid to produce firewood.

Instead, make a chopping block, using an axe and knife and log. Set it down, then "load" it by holding a log in hands and right-clicking. Now switch to either an axe, or an adze, to either chop or hew the log. This produces firewood, bark, and lumber.
